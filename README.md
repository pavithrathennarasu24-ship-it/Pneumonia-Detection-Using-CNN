# Pneumonia Detection Using CNN

## Project Description
This project detects Pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The model classifies X-ray images into two classes: Pneumonia and Normal.

## Dataset
Chest X-ray dataset containing images of:
- Normal lungs
- Pneumonia affected lungs

Dataset structure:
- train/
- val/
- test/

(Note: Dataset is not uploaded to GitHub due to large size)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## How to Run the Project
1. Open `pneumonia.ipynb`
2. Install required libraries
3. Load the dataset
4. Train the CNN model
5. Test the model using sample X-ray images

## Output
The model predicts whether a given chest X-ray image shows Pneumonia or Normal condition.
